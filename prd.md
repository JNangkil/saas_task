# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
*Product Name:* TaskFlow (working title)  
*Version:* v1.0  
*Prepared By:* [Your Name / Team]  
*Date:* 2025-10-19

---

## 1. Executive Summary
TaskFlow is a web-based SaaS designed to help small businesses plan, track, and collaborate on tasks and projects. It focuses on core functionality—task management, project organization, team collaboration, and actionable insights—while maintaining a streamlined feature set compared to heavier enterprise tools like Monday.com.

---

## 2. Product Goals & Objectives

| Goal | Objective | Metrics |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Enable small teams to manage work effectively | Deliver a user-friendly task and project workspace | Task creation to completion rate above 70% per active user |
| Improve team coordination | Provide visibility into team workload and project status | Average of ≥4 active collaborators per workspace |
| Validate SaaS viability | Offer tiered subscription-ready platform | Conversion rate of ≥10% from free trial to paid tiers |
| Support growth & scale | Ensure responsive, secure, and localized experience | Core pages load < 2s (P95), support 3 languages (EN/ES/FR) |

---

## 3. Target Users
- *Primary:* Small business owners, project managers, team leads (5–50 employees)
- *Secondary:* Individual contributors who work within assigned tasks
- *Admin/IT roles:* Manage billing, security, and workspace configuration

---

## 4. Problem Statement
Small teams lack an efficient yet lightweight tool to organize projects, assign tasks, and monitor progress without the complexity and cost of enterprise project management suites.

---

## 5. Scope

### In Scope (MVP)
- Workspace creation and management
- User onboarding, authentication (email/password)
- Project and task management (list, board, calendar views)
- Team collaboration features (comments, assignees)
- Dashboard with activity feed and task summaries
- Reporting (basic burndown, workload visualization)
- Billing settings & self-service subscription management (integration placeholder)
- Role-based access control (Owner/Admin/Member)
- Internationalization (EN, ES, FR)
- Responsive Angular web app

### Out of Scope (Future Considerations)
- Native mobile apps
- Advanced automations/workflows
- Integrations with external tools (Slack, Jira, etc.)
- AI-driven task recommendations
- Time tracking & invoicing
- Offline mode

---

## 6. Assumptions
- Users will primarily access via desktop or tablet browsers; mobile responsiveness is required but native apps are deferred.
- Payment processing will rely on third-party APIs (e.g., Stripe) integrated post-MVP.
- Email-based authentication is sufficient for v1; SSO is a future enhancement.
- Teams are comfortable with self-serve onboarding and minimal training.

---

## 7. Functional Requirements

### 7.1 Authentication & Onboarding (Feature: Auth/Onboarding)
- Users can register using email, password, and company name.

### 7.2 Workspace Management (Feature: Workspace)
- Create, edit, and delete workspaces (limited by plan).
- Invite/remove members; assign roles (Owner, Admin, Member).
- Configure workspace settings (name, logo, default views).
- Billing page summarizing plan, usage, invoices (static data for MVP).
- Sidebar provides a ClickUp-style workspace switcher that lists every workspace available to the user and enables one-click context switching.
- Workspace switcher brand menu offers management shortcuts (Teams, Projects, Reports, Billing, Settings) that stay scoped to the active workspace.
- Global header utility bar mirrors those management links so admins can jump to high-signal areas without losing context.

### 7.3 Dashboard (Feature: Dashboard)

- Views:
  - List view (sortable, filterable).
  - Board (kanban columns by status).
  - Calendar (monthly/weekly layout).
- Task detail drawer with activity (comments, history).
- Bulk actions (assign, status change) from list view.

### 7.6 Teams (Feature: Teams)
- Manage teams (grouping of members).
- Team detail page with member list and assigned projects.
- Team settings: description, default project.

### 7.7 Reports (Feature: Reports)
- Burndown chart per project.

- Export panel for CSV (task list) with filters.

### 7.8 Settings (Feature: Settings)
- Account preferences (profile, language).
- Notification preferences (digest, mentions).
- Security settings (2FA placeholder, session management).
- API keys management (placeholder UI for future integration).

### 7.9 Global Features
- Search bar for tasks/projects (basic text search).
- Notifications via top-bar dropdown (local state; no push).
- Role-based permissions enforced across UI & data requests.
- Internationalization with JSON translation files (EN, ES, FR).

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements

| Category | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| Performance | Core views load within 2 seconds (P95) for typical workspace (<10 projects, <500 tasks). |
| Security | JWT-based auth; HTTPS-only recommendation; secure token storage. |
| Reliability | Graceful error handling, offline alerts for API failures. |
| Scalability | Support up to 100 active users per workspace without degradation. |
| Accessibility | WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for core flows (contrast, keyboard navigation). |

| Delayed integration with billing providers | Medium | Provide manual billing management initially; plan feature flag |
| Localization delays | Low | Begin translation resource creation early, use modular JSON files |

---

## 13. Dependencies

## 14. Open Questions
1. Will we support guest access (view-only) in MVP?
2. Do we need granular permissions beyond Owner/Admin/Member for v1?
3. What is the exact billing model (seat-based, tiered features)?
4. Will we integrate with calendar providers (Google, Outlook) in future releases?
